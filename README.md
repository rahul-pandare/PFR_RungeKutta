# Solving mass balance differential equations for an isothermal plug flow reactor using the Runge-Kutta method
By using Runge-Kutta method we try to reach the solution for the ordinary differential equation given by Langmuir-Hinschelwood kinetics.
For an isothermal system, the given notebook can be used to compute the outlet concentration of reactants in an ideal PFR.
